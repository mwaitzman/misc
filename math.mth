to find the higher of two numbers,

programming version:
```java
double returnHigher(double A, double B) {
  if (A >= B) {
    double C = A;
  }
  else {
  double C = B;
  }
  return C;
}
```/java

f(a,b) = C

example:
a = 5, b = 7;
We want C to equal whichever one is higher
a person can tell that b is higher so c should equal b

5-7=-2
5--2=7

7-5=2
7-2=5

A-B
